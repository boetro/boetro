### Hi! 

I'm Caleb, a Co-Founder of LaunchFlow inc. Where we're making writing Python backend systems as easy as possible. Previous I worked at Verily Life Sciences and Google Drive.

I'm passionate about distributed computing and love learning about new technologies to process data at scale. 

In my free time I enjoy reading books (mostly Sci-Fi and Fantasy) and nerding out on mechanical keyboards.
